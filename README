O'Reilly Connection Grapher
===============================

Feedback: tobrien@discursive.com

Requirements:

	Python 2.4
	Firefox (or Mozilla or Deer Park)
	ClientCookie
	GraphViz

Note: This script has been tested on both Windows and Linux.

1. This program relies on CookieClient to deal with Cookies and handle the 
meta-refresh tags involved in the login process. Download and
install version 1.0.3 of CookieClient from the CookieClient project page 
listed below:

	http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientCookie/

1.5. Download and install Graphviz.  http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php

2. IMPORTANT: This script needs to authenticate with the O'Reilly network.
If you take a look at your cookie cache after logging into an O'Reilly
network site you will see a number of cookies that all play a part in
authentication and access control.  So, instead of writing some nasty
Python script to handle cookies, gendot uses ClientCookie to piggyback
on the Mozilla cookies.txt 

--> You must change config.py to point to your own cookies.txt file 

--> AND, you must log in to the O'Reilly Connection site to put the
    apropriate cookies in your cookies.txt file.

3. Change config.py - If you go to the Connection site, and view your
own FOAF document, you'll see that you have been assigned a Connection
userId.  Please change centralUserId and rootDudeNick to our id and
your name.  

4. In config.py, maxLevel is set to 2, increase this to 3 at your own
peril, and only increase it beyond 3 if you have the express permission
of O'Reilly.

5. Run the script like this:

    python gendot.py

6. Once the script runs, you'll have a file named "foaf.neato".  To
render this file simply run:

    neato -Tgif foaf.neato

That's it.  Here are some ideas:

- Mess with the preamble and the epilouge in config.py.  Read up on 
graphviz and learn about the many different graphs you can make.

- Figure out how to authenticate to ORA network without that cookie
nastiness.  Me, I'd just prefer config.py hold a username and
password and we just use simple BASIC auth.
